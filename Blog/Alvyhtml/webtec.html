                <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As defined by the Collins Dictionary, “technopreneurs are entrepreneurs who start and
                    manage their own technology business.”
                    <br>
                    The name originated from the year 1990s and a blend of “techno” and “entrepreneur” who
                    takes the calculated risks in the techy world.
                    <br><br>
                    Elon Musk<br>
                    The billion Elon Musk has been regarded as a Tech Geeks, who is CEO of SpaceX, PayPal, and
                    Tesla. Further, Elon Musk is known as a disrupture and he has discarded the misconception
                    that the only best way to cut the business cost is outsourcing.
                    <br><br>
                    Elon Musk is always rushing the group of technopreneurs who love to take risks.
                    <br><br>
                    Bill Gates and Steve Jobs<br>

                    award-winning firm of all time, Microsoft. But we never forget the late Steve Jobs.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, the film that has been made about Steve Jobs named “Pirates of Silicon Valley” that
                    give him a title of technopreneur. That biographical film about that man showcases the real
                    picture of the tech world that we have today. It involves all the creative actions involved in the
                    building up of the global corporate empire, Steve Jobs Apple Computer Corporation.

                    competed with each other in the past times on various events. The battle of these computer
                    and software technology is appealing to watch.

                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Needless to say, technopreneurship has played an influential role in the use of technology for
                        fulfilling various purposes. First off, it makes easy for people to stay in touch with each other
                        and comes up with some unpredictable products as well as solutions that are beneficial for
                        the nation.

                        information about available opportunities to turn it into a business with just one click. Plus,
                        technological advancement has been in this generation's DNA that it comes as an anticipated
                        reality rather than a shocking revelation. People expect new technologies to emerge every day.
                        They aspire to get things done fast and easy. Technopreneurs only need to tap into this
                        resource, think creatively, and turn the idea into a successful business venture.
                    </p>

                    <li class="list">Market Expansion</li>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the major contributions of technopreneurship is the growth of the internet. Today, the
                        internet is a primary channel for businesses, be it in e-commerce, remote work, or networking.
                        Because of technopreneurship, the market has expanded. As a result, businesses are able to
                        reach more customers, acquire and choose from the best suppliers, and build better
                        relationships with their target market.
                    </p>

                    <li class="list">Reduced Costs</li>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Consistent with the rapid market expansion as brought about by technopreneurship,
                        businesses are more likely to cut on costs. This is because more opportunities are available,
                        which means that there are more options to choose the least expensive option. In effect, it will
                        bring positive results to the businesses. Likewise, technopreneurs could tap onto this
                        opportunity since IT products and services might just require lower costs but produce higher
                        returns.    
                    </p>

                    <li class="list">Creating Employment Opportunities</li>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When startup businesses, then there is an increase in the pool of job opportunities as they
                        need manpower to run all business operations. In the same way, technopreneurship creates
                        jobs and helps the nation to combat the problem of unemployment. It increases the
                        employment rate of an economy.
